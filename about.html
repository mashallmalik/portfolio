              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>I’m an undergraduate student studying at University of Toronto and I am majoring in Communication Culture Information and Technology (CCIT) and Professional Writing and Communication (PWC). I grew up in the Middle East and came to Canada in 2008. I spent 6 years in the Canadian education system, attending both public and private schools in Mississauga. For high school, I travelled to Oman and completed my IGCSEs and a year of A levels (the British curriculum) before flying back to Canada and applying to universities. With my learnt knowledge from both the Canadian and British education systems I accomplished high grades and managed to get many university offers. I was interested in the CCIT program because there is so much to choose from in this field, and it has a lot of scope. It’s creative, artsy, and teaches several technical as well as communicational skills. After living in two different countries, attending multiple schools, and experiencing various cultures and several different environments, I understand how to communicate and interact with people from many backgrounds. Though my life has been split between two sides of the world, I’m proud to call myself a Canadian and take part in the community of this amazing multicultural country.</p>

                         Socializing with friends and going on scenic hikes or strolls in the woods is my favorite. Outdoor activities and adventurous escapes are my go-to spare-time hobby. However, getting cozied up in the winter with a good fiction novel or picking up a paintbrush and entering a new world of creative art is just as exciting.

                          From Turkey to Spain to Bali, I’ve travelled to around 20 countries and hope to explore more historical, cultural, and scenic sites in the future. I have also come to love both Oman and Canada and consider them my home.
